# GraphQL API (service/subgraph) starter kit

> It is a standalone `@apollo/server` nodejs server with TypeScript support and ESM modules.

### Features

I have tried to setup some key features as a starter only.

- TypeScript support
- ESM modules
- GraphQL API server (standalone only mode [Nodejs(ESM) + Apollo])
- GraphQL Playground
- Pre-setup tests for TDD as sample
- Linters for standard coding workflows
- Docker support
